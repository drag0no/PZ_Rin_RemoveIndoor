description=SAFE TO ADD/REMOVE MID-GAME!
description=
description=Frustrated by black rectangles or odd lighting after tearing down pre-built non-player structures? This mod is designed to fix exactly that.
description=
description=[b]"Rin Remove Pre-Built Indoor"[/b] lets you delete existing indoor markers from the world via a simple context menu (available in a single-player or to Admins in a multiplayer). By removing these markers, you eliminate these visual glitches that remain after demolishing buildings.

description=2. Right-click on the ground and select: `Remove Indoor -> Set Coordinate #1`
description=3. Repeat for the second corner: `Remove Indoor -> Set Coordinate #2`
description=4. Once both coordinates are set, additional options will appear in the `Remove Indoor` sub-menu.

description=[h2] NOTES [/h2]
description=
description=- Custom, player-built structures correctly flagged as `Indoor` will be recalculated automatically once the pre-built indoor area is removed.
description=- [b]Important[/b]: Avoid removing indoor markers if the original building is not fully demolished (especially the roof). Roof tiles will continue to render without an indoor marker, blocking your view of tiles behind them.
